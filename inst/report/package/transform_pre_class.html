<!-- This js code will change the pre tags to add the same class than exist in the code blocks in Quarto
 if echo=TRUE. Additionally, we add the html button with the expected class so we replicate the functionality
 to have a copy button for code blocks but for code output
 NOTE: In case the report is expanded and we have more pre tags that do not need copy button, replace the
 getElementsByTagName for something more specific or add additional condition like select elements by tag and by class later -->
