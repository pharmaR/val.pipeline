# val.pipeline (development version)

- Found out that Posit provides their own validation documentation for several
co-horts of packages they develop, so we've added them to the config's
`approved_pkgs` config element by default. (#42)
- Fix `qual_metadata.rds` so `final_decision` / `final_decision_reason` are
populated for every package (not just dependency-downgraded ones). The
interim pre-propagation frame is now saved separately as
`qual_metadata0.rds`, and the post-propagation frame is written before the
per-package meta RDS update walk so any error inside that walk cannot leave
a stale `qual_metadata.rds` on disk. (#53)
- Add `decision_reason_note` / `final_decision_reason_note` to the
per-package meta bundle, populated with the specific driver metric(s) or
failing dep pkg name(s) depending on the reason. Also shorten the
`decision_reason` for auto-accepted pkgs from
`"Met auto-accepted metric threshold(s) for: <metrics>"` to just
`"Auto-Accepted"` (the metric names now live in the note). Covers three
cases: `"Auto-Accepted"` (auto-accept metrics), `"Risk Assessment"`
(driver metrics whose per-metric `_cat` matched the final risk), and
`"Dependency"` (failing dep pkg name(s), comma-separated — best effort per
the caveat in issue #37). (#37)
- Add `val_pipeline_report()`, a new exported function that renders a
high-level HTML + PDF summary of a `val_pipeline()` / `val_build()` run
suitable for GxP / QMS archival. It takes a `qual_metadata.rds` (and
optionally the sibling `qual_assessments.rds` for richer per-metric
distributions) and writes the rendered reports alongside the inputs by
default. `val_pipeline()` now invokes it automatically at the end of every
run. The template is tolerant of older evidence files: missing
`_note` cols (pre-#37), missing `assessment_runtime_mins` (pre-runtime
tracking), `NA` `final_decision` values (pre-#53), and missing / list-
typed `qual_assessments` metric cols are all handled gracefully. The R
function validates a minimum required column set and errors with a clear
message on truly ancient files. Adds `{quarto}` (R pkg + CLI) as an
`Imports` dependency. (#59)

# val.pipeline 0.0.1

* Dynamically change the packagemanager date used for `CRAN` repo to reflect the
data source at hand. For example, the `riskscore` assessment date or the val_date
specified in `val.pipeline::val_pipeline()` (#3).
* Bug fix ensuring tar files are downloaded for BioConductor packages.
* "Engage" secondary metric logic for non-CRAN pkgs
* Customized `riskreports` package report template
* Added a significant amount of `testthat` tests
* Exported assessment records for compilation / summary
* Corrected issue where some packages repos URL were "unknown"

# val.pipline 0.0.0

* Package born.
